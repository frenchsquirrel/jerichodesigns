                    Small companies, especially local businesses, should have every opportunity to succeed as much as the bigger coorporations. By helping smaller companies look very professional through AutoCAD design or through a presentable website, we are helping small companies compete with the larger corporations.

                    Jericho Designs was founded in 2022 by Luc Jacob. By working for small engineering companies in downtown Vancouver, Luc realized that they all lacked the same thing: accessible means of looking very professional.
                </p>      

                <p>
                    Starting as a AutoCAD technician, he eventually expanded to AutoCAD Design and to Web Design, applying his experience to any and all of small companies' needs.

                <p>
                    Online website building services are either too complicated, too costly, or have an atrocious domain name like https://ownername.wixsite.com/companyname. Luc sought out to solve this issue by creating a face-to-face relationship with local owners and tailoring websites to their needs.
